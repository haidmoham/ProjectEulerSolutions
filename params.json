This is an ongoing project, and as I solve new problems, the solution code will be added.\r\n\r\n### Recommendation\r\nThough I had been aware of Project Euler for some time, it was my colleague Gordon Quach(@GordonQuach) who encouraged me to begin tackling the problems, and ultimately was able to encourage me to tackle them in a similar fashion to the CodeForces Problem Set.\r\n",
